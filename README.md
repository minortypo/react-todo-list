# React To-Do List

In this challenge, I developed a task management application in the to-do list style, which included the following features:

- Added a new task
- Marked and unmarked a task as completed
- Removed a task from the listing
- Displayed the progress of task completion

Although the functionalities were few, I needed to revisit concepts such as:

- States
- State immutability
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization

To complete this challenge, I had to research methods for array manipulation such as `map`, `filter`, and even `reduce`.
